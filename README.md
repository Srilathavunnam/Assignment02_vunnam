###### Good Leadership Qualities


>Good leaders are not born. They are made. If a person has the **willpower** and the ability to learn, he can become a successful leader. A good leader engages in a continuous process of education, experience and training. **He studies to improve his leadership skills and does not rest on past glory.** Oneâ€™s position as a manager or supervisor gives one the authority to handle responsibilities and achieve the desired results making him the boss. Leadership is different. It inspires the followers, >makes them raise the bar and set themselves higher goals.
